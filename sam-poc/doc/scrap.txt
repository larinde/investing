Once this Docker Compose file is up and running, you will be able to access the following services:

Delta Lake: http://localhost:8080
Apache Airflow: http://localhost:8080/admin
MongoDB: mongodb://localhost:27017
Localstack: http://localhost:4566
Azurite: http://localhost:10000
You can use these services to build a data lakehouse environment. For example, you could use Delta Lake to store data in a lakehouse format, Apache Airflow to orchestrate data pipelines, MongoDB to store data in a document-oriented database, Localstack to simulate AWS services, and Azurite to simulate Azure services.
